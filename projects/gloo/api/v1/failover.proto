/*

    Failover configuration for an upstream.

    Failover allows for optional fallback endpoints in the case that the primary set of endpoints is deemed
    unhealthy. As failover requires knowledge of the health of each set of endpoints, active or passive
    health checks must be configured on an upstream using failover in order for it to work properly.

    Failover closely resembles the Envoy config which this is translated to, with one notable exception.
    The priorities are not defined on the `LocalityLbEndpoints` but rather inferred from the list of
    `PrioritizedLocality`. More information on envoy prioritization can be found
    [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.14.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/priority#arch-overview-load-balancing-priority-levels).
    In practice this means that the priority of a given set of `LocalityLbEndpoints` is determined by it's index in
    the list, first being `0` through `n-1`.
