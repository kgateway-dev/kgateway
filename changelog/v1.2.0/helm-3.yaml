  description: >
    Refactor `glooctl` to make it compatible with the new Helm 3 chart format. `glooctl` now uses the new Helm 3
    libraries and delegates the `install` and `uninstall` operations to the corresponding Helm functions to provide
    consistent behavior across different installation flows; for example, it is now possible to install Gloo using
    `glooctl install` and uninstall it using `helm uninstall gloo`, or vice-versa.

    completed.

  description: >
    Deprecated the `installConfig.installationId` Helm value to track the resources that belong to a Gloo installation.
    Helm keeps track of resources by storing release information in a Kubernetes Secret in the namespace Gloo was
    installed in (this is the default with Helm 3 and can be changed via the `HELM_DRIVER` environment variable).
    `glooctl install` and `glooctl uninstall` now take the same approach (under the hood the two commands now delegate
    to their counterparts in the Helm 3 libraries).

  description: >
    Helm users can now easily install Gloo in `ingress` or `knative` mode by using value overrides. The Gloo Helm chart
    now packages a single values file instead of creating variants for `ingress` and `knative`. The values specific to
    those two installation modes have been merged into the default `values.yaml`, where they will be ignored when those
    two features are disabled (which is the default). To produce the manifests specific to the `ingress` and `knative`
    installations, users can now just disable the gateway and enable the desired component via Helm value overrides.

  description: >
    Minimized the use of hooks in the Helm chart. Resources created as hooks are not managed as part of a release by Helm
    (see [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#hook-resources-are-not-managed-with-corresponding-releases))
    and should therefore be used only when strictly necessary.
    Not being considered part of a release, hooks will not be cleaned up when running `helm uninstall`. The documented
    ways to get around this will not work for us though: we can't use `hook-delete-policy` since we have multiple hooks
    that depend on each other (RBAC resources needed by the job), and we cannot write a job to clean them up as this
    would result in a catch-22 (this second job would in turn need its own RBAC resources, and who would clean up those?).
    To be able to clean up the hook resources related to the `certgen` Job, which are needed only temporarily during the
    pre-install(upgrade) phase, we redefine them as `post-install(upgrade)` hooks with a `hook-delete-policy`. This way
    Helm will reapply and immediately delete them after the installation (upgrade) completes.
