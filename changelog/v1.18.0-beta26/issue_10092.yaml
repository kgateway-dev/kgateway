    description: >-
      Adds support for the GatewayClass `SupportedVersion` status condition and updates the ReconcileGatewayClasses()
      method to manage status conditions according to the Gateway API specification. The gateway controller will now
      reconcile supported Gateway API CRDs and set the `SupportedVersion` status condition based on the value of the
      `gateway.networking.k8s.io/bundle-version` annotation.
