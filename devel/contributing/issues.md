# Filing Issues

GitHub issues are the main way for reporting bugs and requesting features in Gloo Edge.

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please take the following approach:
1. Search for existing issues.
2. If you find a similar issue, add a comment with additional information or add a 👍 reaction to indicate your agreement.
3. If there are no similar issues, [file a new one](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/new/choose)

## Bug Report
- Issues should not contain any sensitive information.
- Issues can include links to private resources, such as Slack conversations or private code
- Private Enterprise issues can be used to track Open Source work
- The more details about the issue, the better. Please include:
  - Gloo Edge version
  - Kubernetes version
  - Operating System
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected behavior
  - Actual behavior
  - Logs
  - Screenshots
  - Any other relevant information

## Feature Request
- In addition to the request, include a detailed description of the use case for the feature
- If possible, include a description of how the feature is implemented in other tools

## CI Failure
- Include a link to the failed CI job
- Copy the error message from the failed job (logs will be discarded after a few months)

## Security Issues
We take Gloo Edge's security very seriously. If you've found a security issue or a potential security issue in Gloo Edge, please **DO NOT** file a public Github issue.

*Instead, send your report privately to security@solo.io*
